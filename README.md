> Extract a valid fs path from a string.

**extract-path** is a node library that will attempt to find a possible valid file system path for a given input, validate its existance within the file system and return the matching value upon confirmation.

## About

The main use case for the lib is to be able to take valid path values out of verbose outputs such as those generated by a `git status` command:

- `    modified:   src/Router.js` resolves to `src/Router.js`
- `?? src/utils/__tests__/file.test.js` resolves to `src/utils/__tests__/file.test.js`

This library was primarily put together for usage in [iPipeTo](https://github.com/ruyadorno/ipt) which allows for its users to easily extract a path out of a random input value. Some extra effort was made to ensure **extract-path** works well as a separated lib in the hope that it can be useful for different use cases out there. Feel free to refer to [iPipeTo source code](https://github.com/ruyadorno/ipt/blob/master/src/index.js) as a implementation example if ever needed.

## Install

```sh
npm install extract-path
```

## Usage

```js
// example.js
const extractPath = require('extract-path');

extractPath('Selected file: ~/Documents/foo.js ...')
	.then(path => {
		console.log(path);
		// ~/Documents/foo.js
	});
```

## API

The API only exposes a single function, that receives a `string` and returns a `Promise` which resolves with a single, valid `string` value or `undefined` if there was no possible match.

### extractPath(str, opts)

- **str** `string` value to be parsed in order to extract a valid fs path
- **opts** \[optional\] `object` containing the following:
  - **validateFileExists** `boolean` wether the module should validate the file exists, defaults to `true`
  - **resolveWithFallback** `boolean` uses a fallback system that matches the entire input if a path couldn't be infered from the input, defaults to `true`

## Credit

**extract-path** is heavily inspired by the work done in [PathPicker](https://github.com/facebook/PathPicker) parsing algorithm and regular expressions.
